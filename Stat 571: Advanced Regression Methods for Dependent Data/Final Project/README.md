This paper is an applied statistical modeling experiment on the longitudinal suicide rate by each country in the world. We aim to apply different modeling approaches, including linear regression, linear mixed models (LMM) , generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and generalized estimating equations(GEE) on the world suicide data. We examined both continuous target variable and binary target variable by transforming suicide rate into binary outcomes. We aim to study the relationship between the socioeconomic environment of a country and the suicide rate of its people. We also considered the influence of the characteristics of different sub-population in each country and the specific year when the suicide rate is measured. We measured the performance of different mothods and drew conclusions on the best performing modeling approach.
