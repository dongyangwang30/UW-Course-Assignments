The visualization intends to answer the following question: what are the average hours of sunshine in the six cities across 12 months of a year? Specifically, I would like to know (1) how the hours change for each given city across 12 months, and (2) how different cities compare with each other in terms of sunshine for each given month.To answer my question, I implemented the visualization in R using the ggplot2 package. I first transformed the month variable to become factor containing 12 levels. In this way, my plot will display the months in the correct chronological order. To start with, the x-axis is month, which helps display change of sunshine over time; the y-axis is hours of sunshine, the topic I want to study. I then chose to plot a line plot with points to indicate the accurate data points. For the line plot, I group the hours of sunshine by cities and displayed them in a palette to indicate difference in an observable manner. For the points, I lowered the transparency and decreased their size, so the points would not be so big that would block the perception of the trend as displayed by the lines.I further adjusted a few details. I set a theme with grids and set the y-axis to start from 0. In this way, I obtained a clear indication of how sunshine hours change. At last, I added the tile and names for each axis to assist the reader to understand my plot.Therefore, my visualization displays the change of hours of sunshine, on average from 1981 Ð 2010, in the six cities across 12 months. The reader can easily find the sunshine hours of a given city at a given month and will be able to compare the cities overall or in specific months. The only regret is I was not able to include the latitude and longitude information. But these information are not relevant to our question, and can easily be obtained online if the plot reader wants to delve deeper into the topic.
